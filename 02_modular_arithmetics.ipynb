    "We've looked at multiplication and division in modular arithmetic, but what does it mean to take the square root modulo an integer?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following discussion, let's work modulo `p = 29`. We can take the integer `a = 11` and calculate `a^2 = 5 mod 29`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As `a = 11, a^2 = 5`, we say the square root of `5` is `11`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feels good, but now let's think about the square root of 18. From the above, we know we need to find some integer `a` such that `a^2 = 18`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first idea might be to start with `a = 1` and loop to `a = p-1`. In this discussion `p` isn't too large and we can quickly look.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a go, try coding this and see what you find. If you've coded it right, you'll find that for all `a ∈ Fp*` you never find an a such that `a^2 = 18`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are seeing, is that for the elements of `F*p`, not every element has a square root. In fact, what we find is that for roughly one half of the elements of `Fp*`, there is no square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We say that an integer `x` is a Quadratic Residue if there exists an a such that `a^2 = x mod p`. If there is no such solution, then the integer is a Quadratic Non-Residue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, `x` is a quadratic residue when it is possible to take the square root of `x` modulo an integer `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below list there are two non-quadratic residues and one quadratic residue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the quadratic residue and then calculate its square root. Of the two possible roots, submit the smaller one as the flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If `a^2 = x` then `(-a)^2 = x`. So if `x` is a quadratic residue in some finite field, then there are always two solutions for `a`.\n",
