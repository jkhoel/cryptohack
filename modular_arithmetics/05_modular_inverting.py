"""
Looking again at Fermat's little theorem:

if p is prime, for every integer a:
        pow(a, p) = a mod p
and, if p is prime and a is an integer coprime with p:
        pow(a, p-1) = 1 mod p

We can do some magic like this (a^b means pow(a,b)):
        a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)
        a^(p-1) * a^-1 = a^-1 (mod p)
        a^(p-2) * a * a^-1 = a^-1 (mod p)
        a^(p-2) * 1 = a^-1 (mod p)

So finally we have:
        a^(p-2) = a^-1 (mod p)

So, doing a^(p-2) and then (mod p) we can achieve our result

Another way to look at it is like this:

The problem given is 3 * d â‰¡ 1 mod 13

To calculate d we can divide both sides by 3 which gives us:
  d = (1/3) * 1 mod 13 

And we can rewrite that to:
  d = 3^-1 mod 13

This is what the hint about the theorem eludes to as this is basically the inverse of 3 mod 13.

Or - just cheat and use some library ;)
